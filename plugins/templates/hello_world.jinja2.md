Welcome @{{ target }}! :tada:

Please go through https://coala.io/newcomer (skip instructions about using corobo). Find your first issue and ask one of the maintainers to assign you to it and we'll invite you to the org. Most issues will be explained there and in linked pages - it will save you a lot of time, just read it. *Really.*

*Do not take an issue if you don't understand it on your own.* Especially if you are new you have to be aware that getting started with an open source community is not trivial: you will have to work hard and most likely become a better coder than you are now just as we all did.

Don't get us wrong: we are *very* glad to have you with us on this journey into open source! We will also be there for you at all times to help you with actual problems. :)
