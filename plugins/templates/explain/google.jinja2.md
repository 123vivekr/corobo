Hey. This message was triggered because someone was too lazy to type this *again*. Don't take it personally. Please.

We all got to learn this: *use google*. Or duckduckgo. Anything. The search engine that earned your trust. You got a build error? Search for the first red thing and google it. You got an exception? *Read the message.* Search it. *Think.*

Keep this in mind: *You* are sitting in front of the problem, not us. You will have a much easier time solving it. That's why you should try doing it first.
